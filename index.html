    Content:
            Nodogsplash (NDS), by default, serves this splash page (splash.html)
            when a client device Captive Portal Detection (CPD) process
            attempts to send a port 80 request to the Internet.

            You may either embed css in this file or use a separate .css file
            in the same directory as this file, as demonstrated here.

            It should be noted when designing a custom splash page
            that for security reasons many CPD implementations:
                    Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
                    Prohibit the use of href links.
                    Prohibit downloading of external files
                            (including .css and .js).
                    Prohibit the execution of javascript.

    Authentication:
            A client is authenticated on submitting an HTTP form, method=get,
            passing $authaction, $tok and $redir.

            It is also possible to authenticate using an href link to
            $authtarget but be aware that many device Captive Portal Detection
            processes prohibit href links, so this method may not work with
            all client devices.

    Available variables:
            error_msg: $error_msg
            gatewayname: $gatewayname
            tok: $tok
            redir: $redir
            authaction: $authaction
            denyaction: $denyaction
            authtarget: $authtarget
            clientip: $clientip
            clientmac: $clientmac
            clientupload: $clientupload
            clientdownload: $clientdownload
            gatewaymac: $gatewaymac
            nclients: $nclients
            maxclients: $maxclients
            uptime: $uptime

    Additional Variables that can be passed back via the HTTP get,
    or appended to the query string of the authtarget link:
            username
            password
    -->

        <h2>Info about Stuartchat</h2>
        <p>
            Stuartchat is a local IRC server. You are probably here because you connected to it over Wifi.<br>
            It is all hosted on a Raspberry Pi. You can connect to it using an IRC client on PC or phone. <br>
            Use the instructions below to access the chat server and chat with everyone else on the wifi. <br>
            When you click on the Button below you will get to the Admin panel, you cant access it.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions to connect to the IRC chat</h2>
        <p>
            1. Click on the Button below to gain access to the server. A new site will open, its the admin <br>
            pannel. You cant access it anyways so just ignore it and close the browser. <br>
            2. Download an IRC client for your phone or PC. On Windows I would recommend AdiIRC (you can <br>
            download the portable version). Else on Android I would recommend you download CoreIRCLite <br>
            3. On the App it will ask for information about your server. You can chose whatever you want, <br>
            but the IP is 10.3.141.1 (Server adress) and the Port is 6667. No password required. <br>
            4. You can connect to your new server. To start chatting you need to join a channel, <br>
            you can do the command /join (#channel name), for example: /join #world <br>
            5. You are on the server!
        </p>
